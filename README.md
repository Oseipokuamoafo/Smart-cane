# Smart-cane
The development of smart canes has been proposed as a solution to improve the mobility and safety of blind people. This paper aims to review the literature on Arduino-based smart canes and present a new project, a smart cane that utilizes sensors and feedback mechanisms to assist blind people in navigating their surroundings. The smart cane uses an ultrasonic sensor, a 5V active buzzer, a 9V battery, and the Arduino uno board to detect obstacles and provide location-based feedback to the user. The analysis shows that the smart cane can effectively detect obstacles and provide feedback to the user, allowing them to navigate their surroundings more confidently. Overall, the review indicates that smart canes have the potential to improve the mobility and safety of blind people, and the proposed smart cane could be an effective solution to assist blind people in navigating their surroundings.
